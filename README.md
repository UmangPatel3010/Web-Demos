# JavaScript Practical Demos: React, Node.js, and Angular

Welcome to the JavaScript Practical Demos repository! This project showcases hands-on examples using React, Node.js, and Angular to help you learn key concepts through practical exercises.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside?
This repo is organized into three main sections: React, Node.js, and Angular. Each section contains multiple practical examples that demonstrate important features of these technologies.

#### ðŸ”µ React Demos
State & Hooks: Learn how to use useState and useEffect for managing component state anside effects. <br/>
Routing: Understand how to use React Router for navigating between pages.<br/>
API Calls: Fetch and display data from an API using Axios.<br/>
Component Communication: See how to pass data between parent and child components.<br/>

#### ðŸŸ¢ Node.js Demos
Express Setup: Create a simple Node.js server with Express.<br/>
REST API: Build a basic CRUD API (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage data.<br/>
Authentication: Secure your app with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user login.<br/>
File Uploads: Handle file uploads using multer in Express.<br/>

#### ðŸ”´ Angular Demos
Component Interaction: Use @Input and @Output to pass data between components.<br/>
Routing: Set up Angular routing with lazy loading to improve performance.<br/>
Services & Dependency Injection: Create services and inject them into components for better structure.<br/>
Forms: Work with Reactive Forms to handle and validate form data.<br/>

#### ðŸš€ Getting Started
Each section has its own README.md with detailed instructions, but hereâ€™s a quick overview of how to run each demo.

#### React
1. Navigate to the react-demo folder:
```bash
cd react-demo
```
2. Install the necessary packages:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
Open your browser at http://localhost:[3000] to view the app.

#### Node.js
1. Navigate to the nodejs-demo folder:
```bash
cd nodejs-demo
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the Node.js server:
```bash
node server.js
```
The server will run at http://localhost:[3000].
#### Angular
1. Go to the angular-demo folder:
```bash
cd angular-demo
```
2. Install Angular dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Serve the Angular app:
```bash
ng serve
```
Visit http://localhost:[4200] to view the app.
