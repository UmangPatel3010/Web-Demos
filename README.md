# Practical Demos: React, Node.js, and Angular

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This repository contains hands-on demos to help you learn **React**, **Node.js**, and **Angular**. Each folder includes practical examples that showcase how to work with these technologies in real-world scenarios.

## What's Inside?

### ðŸ“˜ **React Demos**
- **State Management**: Learn how to use `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state.
- **React Router**: Example of navigation between different pages in a React app.
- **API Requests with Axios**: Fetch data from an API and display it in your app.
- **Component Communication**: Pass data between parent and child components.

### ðŸ“— **Node.js Demos**
- **Express Setup**: Get started with building a simple Node.js server using Express.
- **RESTful API**: Create a basic API with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations.
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **File Upload**: Handle file uploads using `multer`.

### ðŸ“™ **Angular Demos**
- **Component Interaction**: Learn how to pass data between Angular components with `@Input` and `@Output`.
- **Routing**: Set up navigation between pages in Angular with routing and lazy loading.
- **Services & Dependency Injection**: Use Angular services to share data between components.
- **Form Handling**: Build and validate forms using Angularâ€™s reactive forms.

## How to Run the Demos

Each section has its own `README.md` with more detailed instructions, but here's a quick guide to getting started with each one:

### React
```bash
# Go to the React demo folder
cd react-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```
Your React app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

### Node.js
```bash
# Go to the Node.js demo folder
cd nodejs-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the Node.js server
node server.js
```
Your Node.js server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

### Angular
```bash
# Go to the Angular demo folder
cd angular-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the Angular development server
ng serve
```
Your Angular app should now be running at http://localhost:4200.
